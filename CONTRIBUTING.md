## Project structure :book:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

File structure was made with the following idea: separate components into their own folders where all the styles, tests, and jsx for that component will be stored.

Folders for components are named in PascalCase, while other folders use camelCase convention. This lets us know whether or not a folder belongs to a React component just by looking at its name.

Components are stored in **components/pages** or **components/shared** depending if they are a router page or shared across the site. Others folders may be created in the future.

Projects architecture roughly looks like this:

## Technologies used

### ReactJS
* [React official website](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* Project is written in "vanilla" React, no Redux and no hooks
* [PropTypes are a must](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

### SCSS
* [Sass official website](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
* Install with `npm i -g sass` or check [other install options](https://sass-lang.com/install)
* [**dart-sass**](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) (or just **sass**) version is prefered over the "deprecated" **node-sass**

### HTML
* There are almost 100 different HTML tags, don't just use the generic `<div>`.  Write [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)!
* Run [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audits from time to time in order to check page accessibility

### npm
* [NodeJS official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NodeJS documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
* [npm official website](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### git
* [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

## Styleguides

### ReactJS
* Components were named after [VSC UI guidelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface):
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/userinterface/hero.png"><img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/userinterface/hero.png" alt="components-names"></a>
* [Component's file name should be in PascalCase](https://blog.bitsrc.io/structuring-a-react-project-a-definitive-guide-ac9a754df5eb#fbe1) and end with **.jsx**
* [All components should be inside components directory](https://blog.bitsrc.io/structuring-a-react-project-a-definitive-guide-ac9a754df5eb#9c70)
* [Components having own folder should have a component file with the same name](https://blog.bitsrc.io/structuring-a-react-project-a-definitive-guide-ac9a754df5eb#1a4e)
* [Components which are used on multiple places on the website are kept in shared sub-directory](https://blog.bitsrc.io/structuring-a-react-project-a-definitive-guide-ac9a754df5eb#e761)
* [Routing logic go in pages directory](https://blog.bitsrc.io/structuring-a-react-project-a-definitive-guide-ac9a754df5eb#df36)
* TODO: Code conventions and style guidelines

### SCSS
* [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) for naming classes
* Mobile-first
* No more than 2-3 levels of nesting in styles (allowed 4 or more in special cases like navbar etc.)
* All sass styles are gathered in **app.scss** with ~~@import~~ **@use** rule to load sass modules.
* [Partials start with an underscore, such as **_partial.scss**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#partials)
* Each component folder has its styles stored in **_index.scss** which is used for [cleaner module imports](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#index-files). We don't use **_index.scss** just to @forward **_component.scss** like we exported **component.jsx** in **index.js**.
* Theme stylings, mixins and other shared styles go into the **components/styles** folder, they are then @forwared in **components/styles/index.scss**
* [Private members start with '-' rather than '_'](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#partials)

### git

- Use the present tense: ~~"Added feature"~~ "Add feature"
- Use the imperative mood: ~~"Moves index.js to..."~~ "Move index.js to..."
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Develop on **develop** branch, but in the future [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) will become the standard
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    - 🎉 `:tada:` when adding new features
    - 👷 `:construction_worker:` when restructuring or formatting the code
    - 🎨 `:art:` when working with styles
    - 🐎 `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    - 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
    - 🐧 `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    - 🍎 `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    - 🏁 `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    - 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    - 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
    - ✅ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    - 🔒 `:lock:` when dealing with security
    - ⬆️ `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    - ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    - ⚠️ `:warning:` when pushing directly to master or hotfixing

### Documentation
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files are used for documentation
* Avoid fancy HTML and CSS in .md files, prefer markdown syntax whenever possible
* Use supported emojis from [GitHub emojis cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)
